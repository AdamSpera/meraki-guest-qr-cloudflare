### Configuring Click-Through on Meraki

## Optional: Setup a custom domain name

Setting up a custom domain requires the domain to be added to Cloudflare under the "Websites" tab, as this process will add a new CNAME attribute to the domain's DNS configurations.

Make sure to update the Walled Garden ranges if previosuly configured! Both the cloudflare pages url and the custom domain name will need to be added!

1. Select the "Workers & Pages" tab on the sidebar.
2. Select the pages project you want to set up a custom domain for.
3. Select the "Custom domains" tab in the main section.
4. Click the "Setup a custom domain" button.

## Updating Your Deployment

Updating your deployment is as easy as it comes!  
Simply commit your changes to the repository used to create the page, and Cloudflare will automatically build and deploy the next version for you! This can be altered, though, to only automatically deploy to a preview branch rather than production.
